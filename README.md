# exense-commons

This repository hosts components reused across a variety of applications built internally at exense and is open for external collaboration purposes. Over time, this project aims to support (in a simple and convenient way) a majority of the features normally supported by complex application servers.

Current stack:
- Jetty 9.4
- Jersey 2.29
- Mongo 3.12
- Jackson 2.10
- Pac4J 4.0.0 (WIP - experimental)

Public developper documentation is currently being build in this repo's [wiki](https://github.com/exense/exense-commons/wiki/Developer-Docs).
